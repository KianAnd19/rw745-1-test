# Compilers Assignment 1 Test Suite

## Installation

This is a very basic test suite that uses the official test cases for parser from CS244.

To run this test suite first enter `pip install antlr4-tools` in the terminal to install the required files to run the ANTLR files.

Then just run `python3 test.py` from inside test_suite.

## Output

The program should output either PASSED or FAILED for each test case, if FAILED then it will show your output vs what was expected.

The program also displays the final results at the end in a table.
